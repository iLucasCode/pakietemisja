## Installation

You can install the released version of pakietemisja from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:
  
```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("pakietemisja")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
  
```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("iLucasCode/pakietemisja")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:
  
```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
library(pakietemisja)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
  
```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
